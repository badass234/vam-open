# Changelog

Notable changes to **OpenVaM**, the open rebuild of Virt-a-Mate.

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). The project is in alpha,
so the minor number moves with each round of user-visible work and only the major/minor pair is
meant to be read as stable.

## 0.1.0-alpha - 2026-09-16

The first public alpha. Virt-a-Mate's code is decompiled, compiles, boots, loads a scene and renders
an animated, lit character. The body skin and the hair read close to the original; the cloth and
part of the character's materials do not, and the recovered code is still the raw decompilation.

### What works

- **Compilation** - `Assembly-CSharp` (2809 files) and `Assembly-UnityScript` build through Unity's
  own compiler: **1421 errors down to 0**, with type parity against the shipped assembly of
  **2753/2753** ([`docs/parity-report.md`](docs/parity-report.md)).
- **Boot** - the game starts, `SuperController` comes up, `isLoading` falls back to `false`, and the
  boot log matches the original game's own `output_log.txt` line for line.
- **Scenes** - `Saves/scene/MeshedVR/default.json`, the scene the original boots into, loads and
  renders. `CyberDemoAlt` loads with all 17 atoms present, 1883 `MonoBehaviour`s and no unresolved
  reference.
- **Character** - the body is skinned on the GPU and follows the scene's 84-bone animation instead
  of hanging in a bind pose, lit by the scene's own lights and IBL: colour space is Linear and the
  IBL globals match the scene JSON.
- **Shaders** - 43 of the 135 shader families the asset contracts name are reconstructed from the
  shipped DXBC: 31 `*ComputeBuff` skinning families and their 12 plain `Custom/Subsurface` twins,
  including the `*TessMapped*` family's hull and domain. Unity compiles **3023/3023 programs**, and
  `tools\verify_twins.py` diffs the 112 pixel passes of the 14 twin families against the shipped
  bytecode: **0 differing**
  ([`docs/shader-reconstruction.md`](docs/shader-reconstruction.md)).
- **Hair** - the scalp and the hair cards sit on the head with the original's colour.
- **Measurement** - a compile gate, a play gate and a manual play launcher, so every claim above is
  reproducible rather than remembered ([`docs/verification.md`](docs/verification.md)).

### What does not work yet

- **Cloth** - clothing renders transparent with its colour inverted. The family the cloth materials
  want, `Custom/Subsurface/TransparentGlossNMDetailNoCullSeparateAlpha`, is not transcribed, and the
  `_AlphaTex` of the bundle copy is empty where that family reads its alpha from it.
- **Part of the character's materials** - a gloss and bump seam across the shoulder and the back,
  and the eyelashes and the eye, where only some of the material slots fall back to our
  reconstructions.
- **92 of the 135 shader families** are still not transcribed - the hair set, the Marmoset IBL set
  and the cutout set among them. They are read back out of the shipped bundle at runtime by
  `MeshVR.VamShaderProvider`, so those parts of the scene do draw: they draw the original shader
  rather than ours, and they keep the game installation a runtime dependency.
- **Post-processing** - no bloom, tonemapping, colour grading, eye adaptation or FXAA yet: the
  stage's shaders are stubs and no `PostProcessingBehaviour` is attached to the scene camera.
- **Physics, UI and other scenes** - untested. Testing is done on the boot scene
  (`Saves/scene/MeshedVR/default.json`), because opening several scenes in one session crashes the
  player.
- **Readability** - the code is the decompilation as it came out: obfuscated identifiers, dead
  decompiler artifacts, monolithic classes. The refactoring pass towards readable code has not
  started.

### Known issues

- Opening more than one scene in an editor session crashes the player. Under investigation;
  `Saves/scene/MeshedVR/default.json` is the scene manual testing uses.
- 25 of the 68 `.shader` files in the project are still AssetRipper placeholders that declare no
  properties and transform only the mesh's own vertices.
- The `Marmoset/Specular IBL Soft{,NoCull}ComputeBuff` fallbacks our generated shaders name do not
  exist yet, so Unity logs `fallback shader ... not found` for them.
- Tessellation is D3D11-only: the `HLSLSupport.cginc` branches refuse the tessellation attributes on
  GLES, so the tessellated family's passes are skipped there.

### Requirements

Windows, Unity **2018.1.9f2**, and your own Virt-a-Mate installation - no game content ships with
this repository. See [Reproducing](README.md#reproducing) in the README.
